#Airfoil

## Codes
1. my_airfoil_bound.m - calculate bound for given low and high fidelity settings
2. airfoil_plots.m - plot results. ie line search, response surface, error histogram

##airfoil_data
Nominal low and high-fidelity data, interpolated from initial Cp_high and x_high. 

##airfoil_process
Contains scrpts facilitate obtaining Cp from PHASTA simulations. 

##results_data
Contains results from processed airfoil data from PHASTA.

##results_data
Contains further processed results for plotting.

##Plots
Plot of results
